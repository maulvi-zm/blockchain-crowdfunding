\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an experimental study on parameter-based digital watermarking for neural networks to support secure sharing of machine learning models. A simple CNN trained on MNIST is watermarked after training using a post-training embedding approach with fixed normalization, and the impact on model fidelity is measured against a non-watermarked baseline. Watermark reliability is assessed via bit accuracy, exact match, and Hamming distance, while robustness is evaluated under fine-tuning and parameter pruning attacks. Results show that watermark embedding preserves model accuracy perfectly (zero degradation) and achieves high extraction reliability (85.94\% bit accuracy), with the watermark successfully surviving both fine-tuning and pruning attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the post-training embedding method for practical ownership verification.
