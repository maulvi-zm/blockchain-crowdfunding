\section{Methodology and System Design}
This work follows a system-oriented methodology to design and implement a private-chain crowdfunding dApp that integrates (i) on-chain business logic via smart contracts, (ii) an off-chain oracle for external data acquisition, (iii) a read-optimized indexer for query performance, and (iv) a wallet-enabled frontend for user interaction. The approach is aligned with the course requirement to securely integrate on-chain and off-chain components and to document oracle API structure and failure handling.
