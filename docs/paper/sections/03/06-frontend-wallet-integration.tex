\subsection{Frontend and Wallet Integration}
The FE provides:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Wallet connect/disconnect and network/account change handling.
  \item Transaction initiation for contract write functions (create, contribute, finalize, withdraw, refund).
  \item Transaction status feedback (pending/confirmed/reverted) and synchronized UI state via BE queries.
\end{itemize}
Reads are served primarily from the BE to provide a responsive donation-style experience (progress, contributors count, campaign discovery), while writes are signed by the user wallet to preserve decentralization. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
