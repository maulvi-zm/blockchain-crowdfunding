\subsection{Development Methodology}
We adopt an iterative engineering workflow with clear interface contracts between components.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We define campaign lifecycle states (ACTIVE, SUCCESS, FAILED) and map each state transition to a contract function and event emission.
  \item We lock the ABI (function signatures + events), REST endpoints for the indexer, and the oracle request and response format before implementation to enable parallel development.
  \item We implement the Smart Contract (SC), Oracle (OR), Backend Indexer (BE), and Frontend (FE) as separate deployable modules.
  \item We verify end-to-end flows (create, contribute, finalize, withdraw, refund) using contract events as the single source of truth for off-chain indexing.
  \item We apply common mitigations such as reentrancy-safe refund and withdraw paths and oracle failure handling with retry or fallback and stale data checks.
\end{enumerate}
