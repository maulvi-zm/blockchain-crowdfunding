\subsection{System Overview}
Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture} presents the high-level architecture. Users interact through a web frontend (FE) that connects to a wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to sign transactions. The smart contract (SC) stores core campaign state and emits events. A backend indexer (BE) listens to events and materializes a database for fast search and analytics. An oracle service (OR) listens for on-chain oracle requests, fetches external data via HTTP APIs, and submits signed callbacks to the contract. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
