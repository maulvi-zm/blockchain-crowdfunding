\subsection{Backend Indexer and Read Model}
\subsubsection{Motivation}
Direct on-chain querying is computationally expensive and poorly suited for
search, filtering, and pagination operations. To address these limitations, a
backend indexer subscribes to smart contract events and maintains a
read-optimized database.

\subsubsection{Event-driven Materialization}
The backend indexer subscribes to the following on-chain events:
\texttt{CampaignCreated}, \texttt{ContributionReceived},
\texttt{CampaignFinalized}, \texttt{FundsWithdrawn}, and \texttt{RefundIssued}.
Each event deterministically materializes state changes into relational tables
(e.g., \texttt{campaigns}, \texttt{contributions}), forming a read-optimized
projection of the on-chain state. The indexer exposes RESTful endpoints that
support common read operations, such as campaign listing and per-user
contribution retrieval.
